# Berkeley-Data100
üòé This is UC Berkeley Data100 **Principles and Techniques of Data Science** Fall 2021 by GreyPreacher(Alvin Zhang).  
‚öî **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook.

# Attention About Labs and Homework
üéÉ For some reason the test files(e.g. q1a.py) need *OK_FORMAT = True* in the first line. You may need to add this by shell command. For me, I use bash command like  

    #! /bin/bash  
    sed '1i OK_FORMAT = True' *.py -i  

to fix the problem
